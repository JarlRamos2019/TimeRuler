# TimeRuler
Benchmarking program written in Python 3 that measures the time efficiency of algorithms. The program runs a snippet of code and measures the
elapsed time it takes for the code to execute completely. It then takes this elapsed time and uses it to calculate the TimeRuler score, which is a measure
of how efficient the algorithm is. The higher the score, the more efficient it is, with the highest scores reaching up to 225,000. Included in this 
repository is the Python 3 code for the TimeRuler program as well as a piece of example code using the McCarthy 91 function as the code to be measured by 
the TimeRuler program.
